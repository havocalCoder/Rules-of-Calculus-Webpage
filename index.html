It never seems to work regardless of whether the orientation is right or not. In the same way, people have a tendency to put a $\frac{dy}{dx}$ where it shouldn't belong and forget to add a $\frac{dy}{dx}$ when they actually need one.</p>

                    <p>But unfortunately for you, all of the other limits weren't indeterminate but you applied L'Hopital's Rule for all of them without checking. Well, too bad. </p>

                    </header>
                    <p>Word Problems! Since 99.9% of all high school students would never dare to touch the theoretical mumbo jumbo of maths such as group theory and complex analysis, word problems would hit them in the face to test their applied knowledge. To the 0.01% of you who will study a PhD in theoretical mathematics, don't feel lucky, because you've got worse coming to you. To the other 99.9%, pay attention because it matters now.</p>
                    <p>When given your fancy solids of revolution problems or your kinematics equations, you'd need calculus to differentiate or integrate for the solution. Don't forget that these values have units. It's all well and good when you have a standard V over T graph because you can memorize that acceleration is $m/s^2$ and displacement is in meters. But, when you get tricky graphs like velocity over time squared, you have to know what its differential equation or integral means, and what units should be applied.</p>
                    <p>However, it's pretty simple to know these kinds of things. For derivatives, you divide the dependent ($y$) unit by the independent ($x$) unit. For integration, you multiply the two. That's because you can treat $\frac{dy}{dx}$ as slope (rate of change), and $\int ydx$ as area under the curve. Just remember that THEY EXIST.</p>
                    <p>Tip: If your final answer is "The boat is moving at a velocity of 1.3 mm/s [north].", it's probably wrong.</p>
